# 4097-code
This repo contains the code for the robot. If things go properly, it should run on the robot.

# Commits
It's completely fine to merge your own code, *however* it is extremely advised that you bugtest your code before merging. Big stuff should be built in another branch and placed in a pull request to be looked over.

# Reverts
Changes can be reverted if they don't work or are otherwise detrimental to the codebase. Reverts can occur at any time.
